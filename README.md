# baby_listener
My first github pushed project... and first personal project.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.juniverse.babylistener_demo

All this application does is listening for sound and make a call to the user provided number.
Basically, I made this application about 5 years ago when my babies were 1 and 2 years old to have a beer or two with my wife when they were sleeping.
Of course, we didn't go too far away; a minute away by running or just next door neighbor.

I opened this project, so feel free to clone away~~~

* Warning *
This is Android only, and the project structure is in old system not gradle.
So, some conversion is necessary if you want to build for yourself.
